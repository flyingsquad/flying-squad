# A Free Adventure Module for D&D 5e and Foundry VTT

The Flying Squad is an elite unit of the city watch. It is recruiting experienced
(level 5) officers. The adventures use standard races and monsters, and can be used in any standard D&D world, such as Faer√ªn in the Forgotten Realms.

All the adventures are contained in the Foundry Journal, with inline macro shortcuts to open scenes, stop and start audio, roll dice, display images to players, open character sheets, etc.

This module imports a series of adventures from the Compendium. You can import them one at a time as needed to save space and loading times, or all at once.

The module includes:

* The Flying Squad backgrounder, including maps of the Flying Squad station,
	the associated Temple of Truth and Justice and the courthouse.
* Eight example officers.
* Ten interlinked cases to solve, including full case descriptions, NPCs, magic items and more than two dozen maps.
* Seven new character backgrounds suitable for law enforcement.
* Hundreds of character, NPC and monster tokens.
* Music for some scenes, other mood-setting orchestral cues included.

Requirements: Foundry Version 10.291 or greater and DnD5e - Fifth Edition System 2.1.5 or greater.
